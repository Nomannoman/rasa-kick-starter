2 SOLUTION DETAILS
The solution is detailed in 8 modules which completes the NSL HIPA life cycle. The modules with individual overview is listed below

Module
Overview Of The Module
Policy Quote
In quote management you can see a user visiting the portal becoming a potential customer by exploring various products and comparing the quotes of the products as needed. Unlike routine workflow, one time documents and details submission can be seen here avoiding multiple communications with the customer for verification purposes. 
Policy Issuance
This module is the core part of the solution where the insurance policy document for auto clear cases gets issued to the customer in less than 30 minutes from the time of the quote purchase which is a huge differentiator in the current health insurance industry.

Policy Change
In the change module a customer can amend any basic details from his/her existing records and also can request a customer care executive to amend on their behalf. The changes are divided into 2 levels i.e., (i) Basic Level (ii) Advanced Level. Based on the change type further segregation of the workflow and underwriting analysis will be seen.
Policy Renewal
Policy renewal is the stage where the continuation of the customer coverage will be seen with minor changes incorporated to the existing policy as requested by the customer. More or less the customer continues the same policy and completes the renewal by revised premium payment followed by transaction confirmation.
Policy Reinstatement
This module deals with the re-activation of the customer policy that was temporarily inactivated / terminated  due to customer delay in premium payment. This is basically the process of putting back the lapsed policy of the customer to normal and active state with an adjustment amount in the form of penalty charges.
Policy Rewrite
In this module reissuance of the same customer policy with revised terms and conditions as per customer preference is seen with new activation and renewal dates. This is interconnected with the cancellation module where the existing policy gets cancelled first and then followed by reissuance as per customer choice.
Policy Cancellation
In the cancellation module you can see the termination of the customer policy contract before it’s expiration due to various circumstances. The cancellation involves active and passive customer retention methods followed by a refund process (If customer is eligible) ultimately connecting the accounting phase.
Customer Portal
This module is a connecting interface between the customer and the Insurer. The customer gets complete visibility on the existing personal records which can be amended and updated here with the support of customer care executives as needed. Adding to this customer can track the key metrics, reminders, support requests or other information such as reference or supporting documents that can be easily shared in this module.

○ 2.1 Basic Details

○ 2.4 Solution Navigation (User Story)
The end to end solution walkthrough starts with the user taking a tour in the portal and then transforming into a potential customer Should 'Potential Customer' be read as 'Customer'?
by purchasing the insurance policy. During this journey of transformation there are many key pointers to be guided for better understanding and ease of solution execution which is provided below as a process flow.

2.4.1 The Policy Quote
Policy Quote is the initial phase of the Insurance policy administration. This is the phase where a user logs in and provides the basic details such as Name and Mobile number to continue with the product exploration. During the exploration part the user will have the provision to go through each and every product offered in detail along with the pricing tags. The products referred are policy products, add ons, coverage benefits etc.
Based on the workflow the module can be further explained as below:
★ Enrolment
★ Quote Comparison
★ Product Recommendation
★ KYC Submission
★ Quote/Policy Purchase
★ Transaction Confirmation
Enrolment
User will start the enrollment process (self/self&family) after exploring the products provided based on his/her interest wherein the insuree details will be provided that includes demographic, locality information, Individual and family health history, Income slab, hazardous habits etc. After providing the listed details, the user will submit the enrollment process.

Quote Comparison
Soon after the enrollment user can have the provision to view the list of products along with the comparison analysis of the individual product quotes. This will help the user to choose the best product that he/she feels to fit in the bill.

Product Recommendation
Based on the enrollment details provided by the user, product recommendation gets started wherein the user will start exploring individual features of the product in terms of coverage benefits and then comes up with a final product that he/she is ready to purchase.

KYC Submission
Out here the user uploads the KYC documents such as PAN, Aadhaar, Driving license along with a passport photograph which will be verified by the machine agent soon after the submission. Parallelly validation of the documents also will be completed which will now confirm the user with product purchase.

Quote/Policy Purchase
Now the user will transform to a potential customer by purchasing the policy through electronic payment gateways such as debit/credit card/netbanking/wallet/UPI etc parallely customer account also will be created and saved in the database for future reference purpose.




Transaction Confirmation 
Now a final confirmation of both purchase transaction along with the welcome onboard email confirmation will be sent to the customer with a detailed summary of the Insurance policy details.




2.4.2 Policy Issuance
This is the crux of the entire solution where the policies purchased will be queued under 2 categories.
Auto Approved
These are the policies of the customers with no associated health risk. Since there is no risk associated, there is no scope for risk analysis and a policy document will be generated in less than 30 minutes from the time of policy purchase by the customer and shared via mail to the customer registered email ID.

Review Required
These are the policies of the customers with associated health risk (Individual or family history) which needs the risk analysis done by the intervention of Underwriter. Based on the risk assessment either there will be a revision of the premium payment done or can get rejected. During the risk analysis the customer will also be advised to undergo a pre medical check up whose reports will be directly forwarded to the underwriter through customer care executive and after the customer health reports evaluation only there will be the premium revision done.
This premium revision confirmation to the customer is mediated by the customer care executive through email and then guidance will be provided to the customer for an electronic payment gateway for finalised premium payment. After the payment, then this policy will be moved to auto approved queue where the customer receives the policy document to his/her registered email ID.

2.4.3 Policy Change
The customer has the chance to amend any of his/her existing records basic details in this phase. Customer has the provision to either self initiate a change or can request a customer care executive to make the change on his/her behalf. Depending on the nature of the change the flow is segregated into 2 categories listed below.
★ Basic Level Of Change
★ Advanced Level Of Change
Basic Level
All the customer details that do not require any supporting documents can be amended by the customer in this phase such as mobile number, name correction, billing address updates, any typographical errors in the existing records. These changes can either be amended by the customer directly or can be requested by the customer to customer care executive to amend.
Advanced Level
The changes related to addons, coverage revisions, changes that needed the supporting documents will be done in this phase by the request initiation from the customer to customer care executive.
With every change request the database gets updated and confirmation of the change details will be sent to the customer's registered mail ID as well as sms form.

2.4.4 Policy Renewal
Policy renewal is the stage where the continuation of the customer policy coverage will be done with minor changes incorporated to the existing policy as requested by the customer. The customer can either continue the same policy for renewal or can update the existing policy with any addons or upgraded versions which will need the premium revision.
The policy renewal can be initiated by the customer or can request the customer care executive to	initiate on his/her behalf. Before renewal the customer provides the health history and current health condition and accordingly the risk analysis is done and premium revision happens.

This premium revision confirmation to the customer is mediated by the customer care executive through email and then guidance will be provided to the customer for an electronic payment gateway for finalised premium payment. After the payment, then this policy will be moved to auto approved queue where the customer receives the updated policy document to his/her registered email ID.




                                                                                          
2.4.5 Policy Reinstatement
This is the stage where the customer re-activates his/her policy that was temporarily inactivated or terminated. Inactivation of customer policy could happen due to various reasons such as delay in premium payment from customer end, background verification failure, non responsive customer behavior etc.Customer has the provision to check the policy lapse details and accordingly can self request for reinstatement or can request customer care executive to initiate reinstatement on his/her behalf. After thorough cross check of the lapse details, the customer can continue to reinstate the policy by following the provided instructions which includes the customer record details verification and payment (adjustment and penalty charges) navigation.After the payment, then this policy will be moved to auto approved queue where the customer receives the updated policy document to his/her registered email ID.

2.4.6 Policy Rewrite
Customer has the provision to rewrite or churn his/her existing policy in which he/she receives a new policy document mentioning all the terms and conditions put across by the customer. During the rewrite process the customer is expected to provide all the supporting documents without which there will be no scope for the reissuance of revised policy document.Based on the rewrite conditions, a medical document needs to be provided from the customer's end and risk analysis will be done if required by the underwriter. Risk analysis might also lead to the premium revision based on the customer’s revised terms. And in order to reissue the new policy the customer should cancel the existing policy with the help of customer care executive guidance following policy instructions.
Once the process of risk analysis is done then the customer opts for policy cancellation and completes the formalities in the cancellation  module so that post final approvals, new policy will be reissued. New policy will be reserved to the customer’s registered email ID and parallely the backend database also gets updated with revised policy changes.
2.4.7 Policy Cancellation
This is the last module of the solution where you can see the termination of the customer’s active policy due to various reasons. A customer can either self initiate the policy cancellation or can request a customer care executive to initiate cancellation on his/her behalf. Cancellation stage starts with the customer login with user ID. After login the customer verifies his existing records pertaining to the demographics, bank account details, policy details etc and picks either self initiate or CCE support for cancel initiate.
If the customer chooses self initiation then the refund matrix table is made available to check whether he/she is eligible for refund along with refund proportion (percentage). Once the refund verification is done then the customer is asked to confirm his/her registered details
Post the registered details confirmation by the customer, a nested trigger occurs to the customer service representative for customer profiling and first level of retention process. Based on the customer’s association with the insurer, premium charges and number of active policies the customer profiling will be done as bronze, gold, silver and platinum. 
In the first level of retention process,  the customer service representative puts in maximum efforts to retain the customer who has initiated a cancellation of the policy. The retention process happens parallely via calling activity while running through the customer records and reason for the cancellation. Based on the output from first level retention, the customer service representative assigns the request to the customer service manager who does the second level retention. Not every customer profile goes for a second level retention process unless (i) The customer profile is gold and platinum (ii) The customer insistes to speak to the high level manager i.e., customer service manager.
In the second level of retention process, the customer service manager tries to retain the customer by putting across rebates and offers as an addon benefit to current customer policy. Based on retention efforts (i) either the customer withdraws the cancellation request followed by an email confirmation to the customer which in return requests for customer acknowledgement (ii) the cancel request moves to the Policy Admin Manager’s queue for approval.
The policy admin manager goes through the complete request since request initiation by the customer and makes the decision to approve or disapprove the request. During this process, the policy admin manager verifies the refund matrix and then even confirms the refund final proportion based on which the refund initiation happens triggering a communication to the accounting team and parallely the customer also receives the cancel request confirmation email to his/her registered email ID.

2.4.8 The Customer Portal
This is the best phase that connects the customer to his/her insurer. We are providing a secure customer portal, with features such as encryption and an updated dashboard which allows the customers to feel safe when inputting private information or accessing sensitive documents. Security is expected so be sure to deliver a secure experience for customers considering no digital experience should remain stagnant.
Customers get complete visibility on the existing personal records which can be amended and updated here with the support of customer care executives as needed. Adding to this customer can track the key metrics, reminders, support requests or other information such as reference or supporting documents that can be easily shared in this module.
This customer portal meets the unique needs of the customers by delivering the content, services and tools specific to each customer. Ultimately this customer portal enhances the customer experience that would best benefit the users.
